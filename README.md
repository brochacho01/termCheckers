Hello! You found my checkers game!
termCheckers is a project by Lachlan Imel.
This project has the WWU CS remote system setup in mind.
It is designed for two users to ssh into the same computer and play checkers with eachother on a local network through two unique terminal sessions.
To compile and run simply enter make run. Note that for a player to connect, a host must first exist on the computer.
